# Larvsync
## http://larvit.se

Sync files automaticly between computers.

The goal is to replace dropbox with an open alternative, where the data always remains yours.

### Requirements
* Bash
* inotify-tools
* git

Use google to install these if you dont have them in your system already.

Now you need SSH-access to a server wich will act as centre for your communication. Then just run the install script (NOT with sudo):

./larvsync_install.sh
